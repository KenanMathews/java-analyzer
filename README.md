# Network Analyzer Application

This project consists of two main parts:
1. **Backend**: A Java application that analyzes function network by identifying Java functions called within a project directory and generates a JSON representation of the data for the frontend to visualize.
2. **Frontend**: A React application built using Vite that visualizes the network data provided by the backend in an interactive graph using D3.

## Backend (Java Application)
The backend is a Java application that processes a directory containing Java code, identifies all the Java functions called in the project, and outputs a JSON file containing the data in nodes and links format for the frontend to display.

### Building the Backend
To build the backend Java application, navigate to the `backend` folder and run the following Maven command:

```bash
cd backend
mvn clean package
```

This will generate a `jar` file in the `target/` directory.

### Running the Backend
To run the backend application, use the following command (make sure to replace `/path/to/project` with the actual directory containing your Java project):

```bash
java -jar target/struts-network-analyzer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /path/to/project
```

This will scan the Java project at the specified path and generate a JSON file that contains the analysis results. The JSON file will be used by the frontend for visualization.

## Frontend (Vite + React Application)
The frontend is a React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which visualizes the data generated by the backend in the form of an interactive network graph.

### Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies for the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Frontend
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the frontend application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Previewing the Build
To preview the production build locally, use:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start a preview server to serve the production files, typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How It Works
1. The **backend** Java application scans the specified directory for Java files, identifies the functions that are called within the codebase, and then generates a JSON file that contains the network data.
2. The **frontend** React application consumes this JSON data and visualizes the network of Java functions and their interconnections. The data is rendered as an interactive graph that can be explored to understand the relationships between functions in the code.

## Requirements
### Backend
- Java 8 or newer
- Maven 3.6+ (for building the backend)

### Frontend
- Node.js 14+ (for running the Vite development server and building the app)
- npm (or yarn) for managing frontend dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors
- **Java version mismatch**: Ensure you're using a supported version of Java (preferably Java 8 or newer).
- **Missing dependencies**: If running `npm install` results in errors, try clearing your `node_modules/` and reinstalling:

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  ```
